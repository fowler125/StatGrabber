Welcome to my NFL stats project! This project is designed to collect and conglomerate NFL statistics for one week in the season. The project includes code for scraping data from various sources, cleaning and organizing the data, and creating visualizations to help users analyze the data. With this project, you'll be able to quickly and easily access a wide range of NFL stats for a given week in the season. Whether you're a football fan looking to dive deep into the numbers or a data analyst interested in exploring a new dataset, this project has something for you.
